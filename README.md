## [Elf Intelligence](https://joefromdenver.github.io/elf-intelligence) is a fun, interactive guide designed to explain the concept of AI Agents (the "Smart Elves" of software) to friends and family. It uses festive analogies, interactive simulations, and a holiday theme to break down complex topics like Large Language Models (LLMs), Tools, and Agentic Workflows.

## Features

* The Basics: Compares standard apps (Rigid Recipes) to AI Agents (Smart Elves).

* Anatomy of an Elf: Interactive breakdown of an Agent's components (Brain, Hands, Memory, Planner).

* Simulation Terminal: Watch an agent "think" in real-time using different patterns:

* Zero Shot: Just answering.

* Chain of Thought: Reasoning step-by-step.

* ReAct: Using tools like search and email.

* Team of Agents: Delegating tasks to specialist elves (Planner, Researcher, Shopper, Buyer).

* Santa in the Loop (HITL): An interactive demo showing why human approval is crucial for agent actions.

* Easter Egg: Try tapping the "Elf Intelligence" logo 5 times rapidly for a snowy surprise! ❄️
